Description: Local SMTP helper
 Laim is a tool to help you deliver messages received over the
 traditional mail system over alternative distriution channels.
 Laim can thus help you deliver mail from cron, unattended-upgrades
 or sudo to your preferred tool for keeping track of system activity,
 whether that be Slack, log files, sending an SMS, or anything else you
 can think of. You write the message handling logic yourself in python.
